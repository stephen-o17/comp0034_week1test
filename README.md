2. [Gapminder code activity](/activities/gapminder_intro.md)

## Set-up instructions

**New: GitHub Fork versus Clone**. The coursework is in GitHub classroom, however the weekly repositories are not. The process to accept the
weekly repos is different. You should first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository to create a copy in your own GitHub account, and then
[clone the forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository). 

You can [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) directly from the tutor's repo without forking however you will then only have
the repository on your local computer and not in GitHub. You will not be able to push changes to the tutor's repository.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository to create a copy in your own GitHub account. 
2. Clone this repository from GitHub in your IDE. Follow the help in your IDE
   e.g. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/manage-projects-hosted-on-github.html#clone-from-GitHub)
   or [VS Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_cloning-a-repository)
3. **Create** and then **activate** a virtual environment (venv). Use the instructions for your IDE
   or [use python in terminal in the project directory.](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
4. Install the requirements from requirements.txt. Use the instructions for your IDE
   or [use python in the terminal in the activated venv.](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
